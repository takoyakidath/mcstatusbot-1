# Minecraft Server Status - Discord Bot

A simple [Discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js) bot that displays the status of [Minecraft](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com) servers using the
[mcstatus.io](https://mcstatus.io/) library.

**To use:** Simply [invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=788083161296273517&permissions=269485072&scope=bot%20applications.commands) the
bot to your server.

## Mar 2025 - Feature Update

- Customise online/offline indicators for each server!
- Add ability to enable/disable ephemeral messages
- Correction of cooldown duration display bug
- New languages: 🇩🇰 🇪🇸

## Mar 2025 - Technical Update

- Updates to bot configuration
- New proxy for all Discord requests!
- Package updates on server
- Router configuration update for improved security
- Add secondary ping server to improve network load handling
- Code update to align with RFC1918 standards (Private IPs can no longer be monitored. Your bot must be publicly accessible in order for the bot to reach it)

As usual, please open an issue here if you notice any bugs/abnormal behaviour. Thank you!

### Usage notes:

**Bedrock servers:** to use the `/status` and `/monitor` commands, you must set the `type` option to "Bedrock" for the bot to function correctly.

**Aternos/other hosting users:** Underscores are not allowed in Domain names! Please change your server address to remove underscores.

**Local IP Addresses** The bot will now filter out local IP addresses (192.168, 127.0.0, 10.0 etc). The bot will now show `Status: Error` if your server's IP address has been filtered. We recommend you use an ingress adaptor like [Minekube](https://connect.minekube.com/) to make your server securely accessible via a domain, and then monitor that domain.

## Features

- Auto-updating voice channels to display the server's status and the number of players online
- Support for both Java and Bedrock servers
- Support for monitoring multiple Minecraft servers at once
- Check the status of non-monitored servers
- Slash command support with ephemeral responses (configurable) to prevent channels from being cluttered with commands
- Multiple languages: 🇬🇧 🇩🇪 🇩🇰 🇪🇸
